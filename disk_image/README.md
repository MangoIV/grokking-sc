# ICFP 2024 Artifact

Name:    **Functional Pearl: Grokking the Sequent Calculus**

## Artifact Instructions

**This image can be run with the instructions below. 
The username and password for the artifact are `artifact` and `password` (the default for the image)**

## QEMU Instructions

The artifact uses the ICFP quemu base image.
QEMU is a hosted virtual machine monitor that can emulate a host processor
via dynamic binary translation. On common host platforms QEMU can also use
a host provided virtualization layer, which is faster than dynamic binary
translation.

QEMU homepage: https://www.qemu.org/

### Installation

#### OSX
``brew install qemu``

#### Debian and Ubuntu Linux
``apt-get install qemu-kvm``

On x86 laptops and server machines you may need to enable the
"Intel Virtualization Technology" setting in your BIOS, as some manufacturers
leave this disabled by default. See Debugging.md for details.


#### Arch Linux

``pacman -Sy qemu``

See the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU) for more info.

See Debugging.md if you have problems logging into the artifact via SSH.


#### Windows 10

Download and install QEMU via the links at

https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows.

Ensure that `qemu-system-x86_64.exe` is in your path.

Start Bar -> Search -> "Windows Features"
          -> enable "Hyper-V" and "Windows Hypervisor Platform".

Restart your computer.

#### Windows 8

See Debugging.md for Windows 8 install instructions.

### Startup

This artifact provides the `start.sh` script to start the VM on unix-like
systems and `start.bat` for Windows. Running this script will open a graphical
console on the host machine, and create a virtualized network interface.
On Linux you may need to run with `sudo` to start the VM. If the VM does not
start then check `Debugging.md`
Note that the `start.sh` and `start.bat` scripts are not identical to the ones included in the base image, but are adjusted to our needs (see the `README` included in the source code).

Once the VM has started you can login to the guest system from the host.
Whenever you are asked for a password, the answer is `password`. The default
username is `artifact`.

```
$ ssh -p 5555 artifact@localhost
```

You can also copy files to and from the host using scp.

```
$ scp -P 5555 artifact@localhost:somefile .
```

### Shutdown

To shutdown the guest system cleanly, login to it via ssh and use

```
$ sudo shutdown now
```

See Debugging.md for advice on resolving other potential problems.
