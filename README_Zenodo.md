# Grokking Sequent Calculus

This submission contains a qemu disk image (`disk.tar.gz`) containing the disk with all requirements and the artifact preinstalled.
The archive also contains a README with additional information on how to load the disk in qemu.
Additionally, the source code can be found in the second included file `grokking-sc-AEC2.tar.gz`.
That code should always contain the same code as the disk image.
